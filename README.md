# California Compost Model

A spatial optimization model connecting California county-level MSW to composting
processing facilites and working agricultural lands, leveraging compost soil 
applications as a means of avoiding landfill emissions and sequestering carbon in 
the State's soils. 

### -- Current Status --
As of **October 2020**, this project is near completion. The full repo will be made public 
with a detailed README.md, including information on toy dataset creation, prior to publication.


## Details
*Inputs*: Tabular and geospatial data on MSW (tons), solid waste processing facilities 
by permit type, location and extent of working land across the state of California. 

*Outputs*: Allocation of feedstock (food and green waste) to composters and allocation of finished compost to fields (cubic meters); economic cost associated with production/transportation of feedstocks and composts (millions of USD); technical estimate of greenhouse gas emissions abated (tons of carbon dioxide equivalents).

*Key Parameters*: Diversion rate (50 to 75%), sequestration rate, feedstock ratio, transportation emission factor, collection/hauling cost, available composting capacity, plus more. The impact of these parameters is evaluated in the sensitivity analysis and can be directly maninpulated in the function that defines the optimization model, 'SolveModel.'




## Data
0. Biomass
1. SWIS
2. Crop Land
3. Grazing land



## Scripts
0. Preprocessing
1. CompostLP (spatial optimization model)
2. Main (Scenario Runs)
3. Analysis and Figures


## Processing Notes
When running with a large dataset, the optimization process can be sped up significantly by running on a larger server. This repo contains a Docker file that contains the full image of the project in order to easily create and run the main model in a virtual environment on AWS servers.
